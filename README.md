This project aims to share the information that we have gathered on Airbnb reviews and other features that contribute to these listing indicators using the data we collected online and scrapped from the Airbnb listing websites. Because customer satisfaction is crucial for businesses like Airbnb, our team decided to look more in-depth into how to avoid the scamming issues that Airbnb is facing which could increase customer satisfaction, using Word Cloud analysis, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling to analyze customer reviews. We also use predictive modeling methods such as Random Forest and XGBoost to predict customer happiness levels. We concluded that using the machine learning techniques helped us understand the Airbnb customers, gave us new insights on areas of improvement, and could potentially help Airbnb solve some of the issues they are facing.
